<div style="color:#C8C9CA;"><div class="subtitle">Appearance</div>
<span class="zs">Demon</span> is the most striking name from my youth. I am told that, if the light shines right, then my eyes can practically be seen through, and become the color of blood. The whites of my eyes stay their normal translucent. Then again, nearly my entire eyes are white. It would be lying to say it does not affect my vision, and others vision of me. White eyes are the defining trait of a Hyuuga, after all. But no, I had no such luck. The defining feature with none of the upside.

Rather, simply white. Along with skin so pale it gets compared to paper, and hair that is just as, if not more, white.

I have tried dying my hair but it is... too striking. Rather, I try to design myself in other ways. Sometimes this means interesting clothing or vibrant colors. Normally this is through jewelry of some sort. Not gaudy golds, but simpler things. Accents on top of a bland palette. Chokers, or necklaces. Any of my many piercings. Sometimes hairclips or bands.
<div class="subtitle">Personality</div>
Others have told me that I am <span class="zs">quiet</span>, <span class="zs">reserved</span>. I like to always say I am simply a good <span class="zs">listener</span>. I am <span class="zs">cautious</span>. I remember, back when I was but a student, a newly promoted genin team found out about my history at the sanitarium. They sought to beat me up and "get (me) out of the village before (I) got them all killed." Did I attempt to engage them? No. Did I flee down the streets, hoping I could lose them, while having no significant understanding of their abilities?

No. I ran into the school, and mentioned this to the first teacher I found. She chided the newly promoted team. And then chided me.

I was technically older than them.

Losing years of your life to illness did that to a person.

The next day, in class, I was called up. I was presented before the class, and my medical history put on full display.

As well as my clean bill of health.

Well, clean insofar as I was no longer able to get others sick. And I took it with a smile. I wanted to make no enemies here, no more than I already had, at the least. But inside I was annoyed. I am a <span class="zs">private</span> person. Not just about my medical history, but my entire history.

It is not that I do not want people to know where I come from, though that would lead to more questions than I care to answer.

I just prefer the <span class="zs">Peace</span>.
