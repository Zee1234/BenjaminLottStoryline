[b][color=yellow]History[/color] :[/b] Nearly two centuries ago lived one Nagi Yajuu. While technically the originator of the clan, he is reviled by the few who still know of him within the Yajuu. So much so that the very name "Yajuu" is rare, most giving it up in marriage or simply lying long in the past.

Nagi was a vile man with dreams of world domination. He sought to create new bijuu and use their power to take over.

While never successful, the Yajuu Bloodline arose from his many experiments, and they were considered a success in their own right.

Nagi first saw the Yajuu as nothing more than weakling failures. In fact, some grew weaker from his experiments. This seemed... odd to him, however. Similar techniques were all failures in their own right, but not in this way.

The test subjects had _lived_. That was _new_.

So Nagi took a few under his "care", erasing, at least partially, their memories. In less than a month, they started discovering their inner potential, and Nagi took great interest in them. They were taking on the features of the bijuu and growing significantly in power.

These results interested Nagi, and he began his experiments once more, this time in full blast. Over 100 children were kidnapped for his horrific experimentation.

Nagi, strong and careful as he was, was neither strong nor careful enough for this scale of crime to be overlooked.

A ninja force was formed, comprised of multiple villages and even missing nin, most out to save their children (either specifically theirs or the children of their village). Nagi, caught off guard, was still able to put up a fight. The ninja force was decimated before Nagi finally fell, his escape attempts thwarted.

The children who had been experimented on, mere dozens remaining, were returned to their homes. As most had been taken from Nagi's home of Otogakure, most grew up their, shunned for their differences and their trauma.

Those removed from Otogakure often faired better, though rarely well. 

The first Yajuu, as the children came to be collectively called, to awaken their Inner Beast fully is the reason Otogakure was removed from the map over a century ago. Afterwards, the Yajuu had to be on the run, having to hide the truth of their identity, lest they be destroyed as dangers, or worse, captured and controlled as assets. Many of the original Yajuu went as far as to never explain the ability to their children, if they even had any, attempting to end the saga of their manufactured KKG from history in its entirety.

The experimental methods that originally created them are long lost. This clan _cannot_ be joined as a Clanless "Discovering their clan" without permission. A character may start with this clan and KKG without requiring permission.
