[b][color=#F46036]What it does: [/color][/b] Members of this clan are, at the most basic levels, broken. Their stats, no matter what they are trained to, are capped at 1 each. While they have the regular stat cap of 250, their bodies will still cap them to 4.

This, however, can be broken by partially Unleashing their Broken Beast. What exactly the Broken Beasts are is described in the Clan App, but below are nine possibilities of what the _full_ Broken Beast might look like.

Each person's "full beast" need not be described fully (unless applied for as a jutsu) but basic ideas of it should be known (base animal, coloring, significant features or attributes) at character creation. Note that these are entirely visually descriptive.

When partially Unleashing their Broken Beast, the user gains access to their entire stat pool, however many they have trained in total. Going forth, this shall be referred to as "KKG Mode".

Users may train their total stats while not in "KKG Mode", the gains will just not be realized until later due to their base form state stat cap.

Entering KKG Mode costs 30 AP, and maintaining it is 30 AP per post. While in base form, users are restricted to 10 AP. This does not limit their overall AP pool, only the amount of AP they can access at one time. The only exception is KKG Mode itself. AP can be drawn from their entire pool to enter KKG Mode, even though it costs more AP than their limit. This limit is *removed* by KKG Mode, allowing users access to their full AP pool (or however much is left).

KKG Mode has no duration limit.

KKG Mode has a 1 post cooldown if turned off. This can be neither increased not decreased by any techniques, skills, items, or any other thing.

The AP cost of KKG Mode can be neither increased nor decreased by any techniques, skills, items, or any other thing.

If a user in KKG Mode runs out of AP, or is otherwise knocked unconscious, then they drop out of KKG Mode into standard form.

A user's health value changes between base form and KKG Mode. 

Any clan stat bonuses from this clan (25 by default, 50 with pureblood) are not included in stat numbers like normal. The phrase "Clan Stats" will refer to these 25/50 stat points.

When entering KKG Mode, the user can apply their Clan Stats in any way. Once applied, they cannot be changed without first leaving KKG Mode.

As an example, McTestFace is a ninja with 250 trained stats and is a Pureblooded Yajuu. McTestFace has the following stats:

50 Vigor
100 Chakra
50 Strength
50 Speed

(though they are only expressed as 1/1/1/1 in base form)

When entering KKG Mode, McTestFace decides on the following stat line after boosts:

100 Vigor
100 Chakra
50 Strength
50 Speed

Note that, unlike with traditional Clan Stats, increases to Vigor from Yajuu Clan Stats _do not increase the user's AP amount_. This means that McTestFace still has a cap of 500 AP, plus whatever has been trained or collected from missions.

By leaving KKG Mode and waiting for the cooldown to finish, McTestFace can re-enter KKG Mode with the following stat line after boosts:

50 Vigor
100 Chakra
50 Strength
100 Speed

Please note that, despite using the word boost to describe it, this _does not_ qualify as a booster or an enhancer, as it merely grants the user access to stats they would otherwise have anyways were it not for the limitations from the KKG.

It is often true, though not required, that entering KKG Mode gives the user small features of their (chosen OOC) Full Beast. Reminder that KKG Mode is only _partially_ Unleashing their Broken Beast. Said features are visual in nature and small scale, if they appear at all. Users can also choose to suppress this expression of traits if they so desire. If there is visual expression in KKG Mode, it A) Must be described in the Character App and Stat Page and B) cannot be useful traits, such as tails or claws (though an intangible tail or claws made of chakra or similar that are purely visual are fine). This is visual fluff up to the creator. If they wish for these traits to be weaponized, they can be registered separately as techniques.

"Fully Unleashing the Broken Beast" is a suicidal (+100/+100) enhancer jutsu that must be registered individually by users, if desired. The jutsu must fully describe the beast that the user fully transforms into before expiring. These techniques are always S rank but do not have a spec. They can only be used by the Yajuu member who wrote it, or someone who took the KKG from said member. This jutsu is always (an additional) slotless technique and can be learned as soon as the user can learn an S Rank technique.

This does not stop users from apping techniques that partially transform them into their Broken Beast for other bonuses (say a +60/+60 booster), but these must follow rules as otherwise required.
