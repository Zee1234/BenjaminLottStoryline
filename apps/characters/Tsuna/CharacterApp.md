[center][b][color=#D7263D][size=18]Basic Information[/size][/color][/b][/center]

[b][color=#D7263D]Age:[/color][/b] 20
[b][color=#D7263D]Birthday:[/color][/b] July 14th
[b][color=#D7263D]Gender:[/color][/b] Woman

[b][color=#D7263D]Height:[/color][/b] 5'4
[b][color=#D7263D]Weight:[/color][/b] 160 lbs
[b][color=#D7263D]Appearance:[/color][/b] Tsuna is somewhat over the expected weight for her height, but there are many people see this as a good thing, though Tsuna herself eventually grew to resent much of it. Standing at five foot four inches, and weighing in at one hundred sixty pounds, some may call her somewhat "plump". Or, as some [i]exceedingly dignified[/i] gentlepersons put it, 'thicc'. 

Red hair and red eyes give her a stricking appearance, her hair grown long, easily reaching her lower back, by 'request'. When able to, Tsuna wears long, ragged robes, put together by one of her elders from discarded bedsheets.

[b][color=#D7263D]Personality:[/color][/b] Tsuna was once bright eyed, looking forward to every day. She would wake up early just to greet the rooster.

Now she is forced awake early to greet the rooster.

Tsuna is slow to react, and defaults to flinching. She is easily frightened, and afraid of what she risks if she ever tried anything. She takes it, hides her personality, dulls it. She is a doll, one that does not complain, just accepts and agrees. Someone to be toyed with, ignored. She is, and has been, passive.

[b][color=#D7263D]Dislikes:[/color][/b] Most everything else in her life

[b][color=#D7263D]History:[/color][/b] Tsuna grew up with her parents and a sister. They had a small farm, growing multiple different things, with a handful of animals. Mostly chickens, but there was also their trusty cow.

Tsuna was young when she was taken. At those early ages, she was treated well enough. Made to clean, other simple tasks. The work she had done at home. Though with the added severity of what happened if she made a mistake.

Many years were spent in this sort of uneasy working. Nothing felt good, but she could handle this. She made friends with some of the other workers. They were all various ages, but... but they were nice.

It was her second summer when one of her friends was taken away again. The other children did not mention it. Did not acknowledge it. When Tsuna asked about it, they told her to forget it. They told her they would tell her 'when she was older'.

It was four more years before Tsuna fully figured it out, and only four years after that would it be 'her turn'. She remembers being walked out gracefully from the posh mansion, having been dressed in fine clothing.

If she had not known what was going on, she would have considered it an honor.

[hr]

Six years. Six years of hell. Six years of being taught that even the slightest bit of resistance was punished harshly. Six years of being used and abused.
