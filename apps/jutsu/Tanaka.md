[b][color=#D7263D]Backstory:[/color][/b] This is the technique derived and improved over generations with the Tanaka clan to introduce the virus to new hosts safely and permanently. This specifically is the process required to introduce the virus to an adolescent or adult. 

[b][color=#F46036]Appearance:[/color][/b] The process is multi-faceted and is not short. Most steps appear mundane, even if chakra assisted. The only step outwardly obvious to use chakra is a light glow around the hands during the final step.

[b][color=#F46036]What it does:[/color][/b] Description will assume "the target" is either willing or entirely restrained.

The user of this technique draws some of their own blood, a small amount, and uses their chakra to partially disinfect it. This takes an entire post to properly complete.

After the partial disinfection, the vial of blood is injected into the subject. This takes an entire post, meaning it takes at minimum two posts to get to this stage.

Finally, using their chakra, the user propels the virus throughout the target's body, effectively bringing about a total body infection within moments. This process takes two entire posts, meaning this jutsu takes at least four posts to use and finish. While visually uninteresting (the user is unmoving with their hands on or over the target's chest), this is a complex step to spread the virus nearly everywhere and render it stable with the target's immune system. The user must be unmoving and focused for the entire two posts or the technique fails. 

Reminder that the Tanaka virus, while originally a deadly plague, was heavily weakened even in the very first Tanaka. If the virus laden blood is successfully injected into a target, but the technique is not finished properly, the worst case scenario is a mild flu for the target. 

This jutsu requires four posts to perform, the last two of which must be in a row. The entire AP cost is paid in the third post, no AP is drained in the other posts. This technique can only be used once a topic. Failure of the technique means a retry must wait for another topic. 

The user and the target must each write 1000 words in the topic for a successful transference. Similarly to a bloodline, the target will have to write 2000 words familiarizing themselves with the virus afterwards before being able to learn Hiden techniques. That need not be in the same topic.
