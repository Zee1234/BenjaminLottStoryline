[b][color=#F46036]Effect:[/color][/b] Similar to [url=https://www.narutoroleplaygame.com/t45556-chakra-suppression-v7]Chakra Suppression[/url]. Allows the user to lower their chakra levels temporarily to civilian levels. If the user uses anything aside from E rank level techniques, such as Surface Walking, then the user will be instantly fully revealed with the suppression being removed.

Any jutsu, skill, doujutsu, or otherwise that have partial or complete detection through [url=https://www.narutoroleplaygame.com/t45556-chakra-suppression-v7]Chakra Suppression[/url], or otherwise partially or totally ignores the effects of Chakra Suppression, also apply to this technique. No exceptions unless, for some reason, the application for the jutsu, skill, doujutsu, or otherwise specifically calls it out.

A user cannot use this to alter their chakra signature, only to weaken it.
