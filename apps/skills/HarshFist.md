[b][color=#D7263D]Skill Name:[/color][/b] Harsh Fist

[b][color=#F46036]Appearance:[/color][/b] For A and S rank techniques, a barely visible blue haze can be seen appearing at the site of contact and travelling to the target with the hit. 
[b][color=#F46036]Backstory:[/color][/b] Many generations passed between the emergence of the Tanaka as a ninja clan and the rise of a clan member to relevance. While many had toyed with the idea of using their born virus to cast ninjutsu and medical jutsu, the first prominent Tanaka choose hand to hand combat. "Harsh Fist" is not a name she choose for the style, but rather one granted to it by onlookers. While the Tanaka, even with a 'prominent' member, were still relatively unknown, the Hyuuga were another matter, and the name of their fighting style was at least vaguely understood. The name "Harsh Fist" stuck around because, while the style had similar effects to the Hyuuga's Gentle Fist, there was very little precision in the style. 

Gentle Fist techniques often involve careful movement and specific strikes. Harsh Fist techniques are nearly the exact opposite. The user tries to strike as hard as they can to saturate someone's body with virus through the strike, at the point of collision. _Where_ they hit matters far less than _how hard_ they hit. While not quite as effective as the precision strikes of the Hyuuga, the Tanaka make do, and enjoy the surprise when people who know of and about Gentle Fist realize a fighting style so opposite is affecting them much the same way.
[b][color=#F46036]Effect:[/color][/b] The user forces viral particles from inside their body _outside_. This is assisted by using the concussive force of taijutsu, rather than forced purely by chakra like some ninjutsu techniques may do. During these motions, the virus is tuned specifically for attacking chakra systems.

Reminder that, for the Tanaka, the act of making the virus stable in their own bodies renders it non-lethal. There will be no infection nor lasting symptoms beyond the topic these techniques are used (unless the player specifically wants to RP as a character with a mild flu, I guess, either way it is the effected player's choice and only theirs).

Any Harsh Fists techniques most both mention that they depend on Harsh Fist, and mention that they gain the benefits of being a Harsh Fist technique. Said benefits are as follows.

Any Harsh Fist technique that makes contact with a person (this includes through clothing, but not through shields, weapons, or the like), even if the damage is blocked or negated, removes AP based on the rank of the technique. This will drain 1/5/10/20/30/50 AP for Harsh Fist taijutsu ranked E/D/C/B/A/S, respectively. If the user devotes themselves to the craft with the [url=https://www.narutoroleplaygame.com/t50203-clanless-pureblood]Clanless Pureblood[/url] skill, this increases to 3/10/20/30/45/60 for E/D/C/B/A/S rank taijutsu, respectively.

Taijutsu techniques that are not registered as Harsh Fists techniques can still use this skill. However, they require the user to pay an additional half of the AP cost of the technique, and can never benefit from the Clanless Pureblood skill. For example, if a generic E rank taijutsu costing 10 AP and Harsh Fist were to be added by a character with the Clanless Pureblood skill, the new AP cost would be 15 AP and it would drain 1 AP from a hit target.

Harsh Fist users _do not_ gain any AP drained this way. Furthermore, only one instance of this drain can occur per post.

This skill can be used with NEITHER techniques that require "Taijutsu and/or another specialty" unless specifically stated to work this those techniques, NOR with Special Jutsu Types like Enhancers period. For example, [url=https://www.narutoroleplaygame.com/t52634-lightning-release-armor-v7-2]Lightning Release Armor[/url] could not be used with this for two reasons. Reason one, the listed specialties are "Taijutsu or Ninjutsu", and seeing as the app does not even mention Harsh Fist, it is exempt. Reason two, it is a Special Jutsu Type, specifically an Enhancer, which renders it exempt no matter what. This technique also cannot work with any ranged taijutsu, or any taijutsu or skills that do not have direct contact.

This does not stop one applying for Special Jutsu Types with similar effects, but it _does_ stop them gaining benefits from this skill. The specific techniques would have to follow Special Technique guidelines and gain no benefit from this skill, though they can require this skill if desired.

For non-Harsh Fist techniques, the decision to use this skill, and associated AP costs, are made and paid when starting the technique, rather than upon hitting.

This skill _does not_ change that Taijutsu is strength primarily.
