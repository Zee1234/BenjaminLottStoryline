title: A Dollar Short
---

Ben was a normal guy. Everywhere he went, he was just... normal. Strong, yes, but not in the sense of training. Just from a history of working construction. Every day he would wake up, ask Toshiro if he knew of any odd jobs to pick up, and then Ben went on his way.

But... the town was small, and people mostly self sufficient. Ben would be able to coast on earnings he got from helping put up a barn and a shed. But he was faced with the reality that... this would not be enough to keep going.

He would need to do more.

So, some days, if the working was done particularly early, Ben would return to the inn and, from a hidden compartment in his suitcase, would retrieve a mask and a cloak. It was far from the best disguise, but he was new in this area, and hoped to... just not have to deal with it much.

Today's order was a bit... Much. Well, order was a bit strong perhaps? See, Ben had gotten in contact with the lord of the land, offered his services as a roaming ninja "though not a terribly skilled one". Sometimes the lord contacted him by leaving a slip of paper under a rock in a nearby cave. Ben assumed that was actually placed there by an attendant or... slave. Ben shivered at the thought of the later. He did not recall any slaves from his time in Iwagakure, or from his travels. But he also never thought to look for it. It sent a chill down his spine to imagine he might has missed obvious signs of the act.

But that was neither here, nor there. Next to him sat a man that had passed out. Drunk.

He awoke to find himself gagged, his legs bound, and his torso tied to a chair.

Ben had always been good at making voices. Perhaps in another life, another time, he was destined to have been a star in Claymation and Animation as your favorite hero! Or villain.

Here, however, it served one purpose. Ben's voice, despite his size, was not particularly deep. He could go far deeper if he tried, though, and that is what he did.

"Do you know how much shit you're in?"

The man seemed to be finally realizing what was going on. He began to scream for help.

"We're in a cave, far from town, nobody is going to come help."

He still screamed until his voice went hoarse.

Ben sighed as the man finally quieted down. "So much debt. For what? Some drinks with friends? What do they even do for you? I spent some time researching you, you know. Nice wife. Betcha you've got a kid on the way. Not sure if she's told you yet, though. May not even realize herself yet. I may be wrong. But I ain't young, and I can understand signs when I see them."

Ben stood up from the rock across from where the man was bound. "I saw so many people working to get you a good house. That ain't easy work. It's backbreaking. And I saw your wife there plenty, doing what she could."

Ben leaned close to the man, his mask being quite possibly the only thing between the two. "And you are going to throw your life away in debt to get drunk."

Ben walked back to the rock.

"I-" began the man.

"Shut it," interrupted Ben.

He sighed once one, a deep, forlorn sigh.

"I, personally, _I_ am giving you one more chance." He holds up a not insignificant amount of money. The man looks confused at Ben. "I'm going to pretend I got this from you, tonight, here. It's a bit more than I was told to collect from you. In exchange, you're to go home and set things right. Quit the drink."

"But-" he began, but Ben interrupted him once more.

"But nothing. You quit the drink, or you end up back here. I'm not the only one that works for the guy. You get someone else, you're probably dead, and they'll start harassing your family for money instead."

The man gulped. "And if you get me again," Ben began.

"Don't think I'll kill you. But I'll make sure you can't drink again. I can only think of a few ways to do that, and none of them are a pretty fate. I'd be upset about removing the hands of a potential laborer, but you don't do much work as is anyways."

Ben stood up and walked over to the man's chair.

"So make sure no one ever brings you here again. OK?"

The man nodded, and with that, Ben removed his bindings, and watched as he stood up and rubbed his wrists.

Then he ran, fast as he likely could. Jamie ran until Ben could see him no longer.

Ben stashed the money in his pocket, and went to deliver it to the exchange point.
