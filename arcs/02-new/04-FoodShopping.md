The house was nearing completion, and Ben had been hard at work.

These days, however, Jaime was right at his side. Ben did not know much, but apparently Jaime had a few rough nights after 'miraculously changing his ways as if overnight'.

Ben knew what happened, but it was easy enough to act pleasantly surprised. 

Apparently Ifuma and Kain had been coming around a lot less, two. They were still drunkards, but apparently Jaime had been funding their escapades and most of their drinking habit. So with Jaime gone, and all evidence pointing to them still drinking their asses off, Ben could only imagine the amount of debt they were going into.

But that was neither here nor there. Dari had declared that 'that was enough for today' and everyone, Ben included, was packing up. It would probably only be two or three more days until the house was done.

Then Dari approached Ben and asked: "Ben, mind helping me out with some shopping tonight before you go?"

Ben saw no reason why not to and said "Sure." With that, the pair of them would start heading back into the town proper.

To call it a shop would maybe be a bit dishonest. There were a bunch of stalls set up, and people were selling various excesses they had grown, or raised, or harvested in some other way. Much like a Farmer's Market, but as the Main Shop for the town.

Yeah, it was a pretty small place.

"Thank you," Dari said, as the pair were walking down a path, not a soul in sight.

"Not a problem. You're paying me after all."

"No no, I-" Dari began, coughed once, and then started again. A little raspy this time, "I head it was a nice looking mask."

Ben paused for just a moment. The statement caught him off guard and... he quickly realized that he needed to act natural. If Dari meant what Ben feared...

"I'm not sure what you mean," he simply replied.

"Oh, I must have been mistaken," Dari said, and continued to walk down the path. But he seemed to be smiling more now.

As the pair walked around, Ben carrying a bad of corn, a bag of tomatoes, and a bag of various cheeses, he became more and more aware of the reality that this whole expedition was probably an excuse for Dari to thank him in private.

Ben still kept up his promise. He carried things around. When Dari was picking through different types of cheese, Ben pointed out a type that he had had as a kid that he vaguely remembered liking.

Ben might also have picked up some of the soft and sweet cheese for himself. He had a bit of a sweet tooth sometimes.

And not enough forethought to realize he had no way to keep them cold.

That would not be that bad for most cheese, but these ones would have gone bad sooner.

After asking Dari, he handed off most of the sweet, soft cheeses to Dari to store. He could get them later.

Or whenever he got a fridge.
