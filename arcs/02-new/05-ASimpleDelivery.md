title: A Simple Delivery (Mission)
---

Getting out of bed was the easy part.

Ben was still not sure about this town. The people here, by and large, seemed nice enough. But there was something distinctly fucked the fuck up.

The lord of this area seemed... all too eager to do some things. He funded alcohol habits, and other, often more detrimental habits, and used the funding to extort people for inordinate amounts of money. This had happened with Jaime, and Ben had seen it happen with others, too. It was not a pretty sight.

The lord also seemed... more than willing to employ people of certain proclivities to retrieve the money due him.

Ben tried to take on those jobs when he saw them but... Well he had no direct interactions. Everything was at least three steps removed, not even including the step where Ben was pretending to not be _Ben_ when dealing with those jobs.

Somehow even worse was how the current lord had come into power. That, however, was not something Ben needed to worry about right now. Apparently, shortly after the current lord came into power, the number of bandits in the area rose drastically. While the towns themselves were seemingly as safe as they had ever been, the route between towns was significantly less so. From the rumors Ben had picked up, these were not individuals trained in the ninja arts. However, because this land was so far from any ninja lands, the cost to bring out, and especially to keep, bodyguards around was prohibitively expensive.

That had led to Tami asking for Ben's assistance. She remembered how he reacted that night at the bar, and knowing he was at least on the stronger side, well, she wanted the assistance.

But Tami never asked Ben. She considered it far too much to ask of someone. She did, however, complain to Dari on more than one occasion, and he recommended, on more than one occasion, asking Ben for help. At every step of the way, though, she had stubbornly refused. So today, at the suggestion of Dari, Ben just _HAPPENED_ to be going to the neighboring town of Tokorono because he just _HAPPENED_ to be bored, and he just _HAPPENED_ to mention his desire to go the previous night around the poker table while also _HAPPENING_ to mention that he actually had no idea how to get there!

Tami was not dumb.

But she _was_ thankful.

"So," Ben said, elbow on the edge of the cart, hand massaging his forehead because... "Your donkey is named Meiru  and you've named your cart Meriu."

"Yep," replied Tami.

"But-" Ben took a deep breath. This would take all his willpower to ask carefully. "But why?"

"Why not?"

Ben sat there a moment, his palm lightly touching his nose, before the tiniest of noises escaped his lips. One sound led to another, volume increasing and increasing. Tami would have been afraid, but...

It was laughter. Ben was laughing. The laughs came from a deep place in his chest. His guffaws literally shook the cart.

That was not quite so impressive a feat considering that the cart was rather old and had not been maintained in quite awhile.

But that was besides the point! Ben was having a right good time, and so was Tami! She could not _not_ laugh after all the ruckus that Ben was making, after all!

Her laughter _was_ a bit more controlled, but... Emphasis on _bit_. It was still a good, hearty laugh, not some measly chuckle. The two of them laughed for a good few minutes. At some point, they were no longer laughing at the absurd naming scheme that Tami's granddaughter had had, but rather laughing the other person was laughing, or had laughed, and that was funny in some weird way that neither of them quite understood but would both agree on if someone even thought to potentially ask them about it.

Tami was the first to try to break the chain. "Aight, that's enough laughing from the two of us," she said.

Ben then stared laughing at _that_, and then Tami couldn't resist laughing more.

For a ``pretty boring journey'', the two of them seemed to be having a good time.

***

The idle chatter had fallen. Ben was enjoying the scenery while not having to walk but... he was aware that Tami was on edge here. While he did genuinely enjoy the scenery of the area, he was not going to forget why he was there in the first place.

Honestly, his presence alone, according to Dari, may be enough to make the trip go seamlessly. "Big guy" was a scary idea, and there weren't enough ninja, let alone strong ninja, in this part of the world for people to have gotten used to the idea that _looks don't fucking matter_.

Ben's niece could handedly beat him in EVERY SINGLE FUCKING THING when she was _twelve_. That sort of thinking just couldn't pass muster where he was from, and that same idea followed him everywhere.

Then he got to the Land of Honey, and he noticed that... was not quite so pronounced. And the further east he went, the more than realization seemed to fade away.

And way out here?

Nothing. There was not even a hint of it left. That was one of the things Ben truly despised about this area. Not the specific town he was in, but... that also seemed to have a pretty lackluster reasoning.

They still remember that Lester's two daughters, who went through ninja training, were pretty amazing in their own rights. Until someone literally burnt their house down with them inside. 

That was... not an easy story for Ben to have heard about.

Ben told himself sometimes that the town probably was not that oblivious and, frankly, backwards before that, either, but... 

He did not know.

And he kind of did not want to know.

Rather, he preferred finishing the delivery in peace.

And whether it was because he was there, or just it was a slow day, that is exactly what the pair accomplished.
