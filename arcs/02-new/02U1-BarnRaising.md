This is what Ben was used to, picking things up, carrying them, aligning boards, nailing things together...

***

It was Ben's fight night in Nikko. Well, it had been. He was already awake and dressing, heading down the stairs to speak with Toshiro.

"Hey," Ben said as he walked out the stair doorway. "Hello," Toshiro replied, before continuing on. "Thanks for that assistance last night."

"No worries," said Ben. "Didn't seem right that they were so drunk but wanting more. Don't want it on my conscious if someone were to get alcohol poisoning that I coulda stopped. Ben took a seat at one of the bar stools. "Can I get some water for the morning?" he asked.

Toshiro replied "Yeah, sure, give me a sec," before turning around and grabbing a glass, then placing it under the tap.

"So," said Ben.

"So?" asked Toshiro.

Ben sighed, then spoke up. "So I... kind of need to pick up some work if I'm going to be staying for awhile."

"Well, do you want to stay for awhile?" Toshiro asked, picking up on Ben's hesitancy.

"I... I don't honestly know."

"What makes you think you might want to stay?"

Ben shrugged. "I can't rightly say. Just that, I've been so many places, and none of them really felt like home."

"And this place does?"

"No." Simple, matter of fact. Ben had not even paused before answering the question. "But... I'm not sure anywhere will, at this point. And with how far I've come, maybe it's time to just... stop."

"Where you from, then, if you've come so far?"

Ben smiled, looking into the water that swirled as he moved his hand, and thereby the cup.

"It feels like such a long time ago. I did construction back in the Earth country." Toshiro whistled. "Not much point now, don't think they'll ever rebuild that place."

The implication was obvious, Ben had come from Iwagakure. This was not some secret Ben was trying to hide, but it would possibly put a target on his back.

"Yeah, that's pretty far."

"I hit the Eastern ocean before I walked back to here."

Once more, Toshiro whistled. "That really is quite the journey." Then, thinking for a few moments, Toshiro said more. "You said you were in construction, right?" 

Ben nodded.

"You remember Dari from last night?" he asked.

"Yeah," Ben replied.

"He's helping set up a new place for some of his kids. If you head out there, you may be able to get some cash. At the least you'd get more in the good graces of some of the townsfolk."

Ben smiled, and drank his water. "Thanks, Toshiro. I think I'll do just that," he said before heading back upstairs to get on something more fitting.

A pair of worn work jeans, a long sleeve white shirt, and a large brim hat. That is the attire Ben wore as he walked towards the place that Dari was working on a new house. It was awhile before Dari noticed him, but Ben was still walking there so there was no rush. Dari gave a quick wave, which Ben reciprocated. When he was eventually close, Ben waited for Dari to finish shouting out an instruction and then asked "How's the building coming?"

"I take it Toshiro told you?" he asked. He looked... hesitant.

"Told me you were working on something for family. Not much else, though. I used to be in construction back home. Figured I could help out here, if you wanted any help."

"Ah," Dari responded. Something seemed to be bothering him, though. "Look, thanks for coming, but, I think you should know that I'm helping build this place for my grandson. For..." He sighed. "For Jamie, from last night."

"Ah," Ben responded. How he understood the hesitation in Dari's voice. "Was last night normal for him?"

Dari sighed. "Not a year ago, but ever since he started going around with Kain and Ifuma, it has gotten a lot worse."

Ben nodded. "I see. Well, you want help putting the place together?"

Dari blinked, confused. "You sure?" he asked.

"Yeah. Not like I got anything better to do, unless I plan to start walking west again."

Dari nodded, and gave Ben a quick rundown of what they were doing, what was where, and that stuff.

It was about halfway through the day now. Ben had not been working constantly, he took breaks, he was not insane, but he had spent much more time working on various things than not. The various people working together to build this place were not, at least by trade, builders. They each had their strengths in different tasks, and Ben did not consider any of them weak, but even with the ability he had before his niece's training, he could tell they were not construction workers.

Or perhaps be had been a bit less normal than he thought right from the outset.

There was a lady bringing around lemonade now. Ben had seen her working on various parts of the foundation earlier today. Seemed alright, but a bit distraught. And she seemed to look at Ben with... Well kind of a blank stare, and seemed to look away when Ben looked towards her.

Not always, she wasn't obsessing with him but... It was often enough to be noticeable.

When she offered Ben some lemonade, she simply said "Thanks for helping with my house. I hope my husband didn't cause too much trouble last night."

Ah. That explained a lot about the strange look. "I don't mind, miss, but I don't wanna go putting words into others mouths. He didn't cause me much trouble, saved me lodgings price last night, but can't rightly speak for the rest."

Ben gladly accepted the glass and chugged it down quickly. When she offered more from the pitcher, he shook his head. "I'm all good, Miss..."

"Mio", she replied. "And thank you," she said, before walking away to check on some other stuff.

The rest of the day was largely uneventful. Though Dari did think him for the help, mentioning that they had planned for the foundation to be a two day job, but with the extra help they had gotten it done today, earlier than they expected to be heading home.

Ben accepted the thanks, but was quietly glad to be helping someone out. Honest work, rather than what he had had to do while travelling.

It felt a lot better, to him.
