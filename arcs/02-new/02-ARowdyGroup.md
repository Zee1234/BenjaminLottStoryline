"You're deal, Ben," said Dari, handing him the deck of cards. While not an amazing shuffler, Ben could at least manage to shuffle without dropping the cards everywhere.

Ben went ahead and pushed his ante into the center of the table and then faked impatience as the other players pushed in theirs. Dari was starting to get low on funds, but so was Ben. Certainly not the best at this game.

"One two three four, two two three four," he said as he dealt out the cards. At this point, it was a joke. Ben had been playing with them for awhile, he knew each hand was just two cards. But they all had been calling out every card dealt, just like that, and frankly? Ben just did not feel like changing it up! It was fun, in a somewhat strange way.

He took a sneak at his cards. Well, not really sneaking a peak, since he could legally look. And he grimaced.

Before anything is thought of Ben, he's not that bad! He just did not like staying stone cold solid. And really, if they'd been paying attention, they'd realize the grimace probably meant he felt alright with his hand.

Dari might have broken out in laughter.

Putting his cards back down, Ben picked the deck back up, burned, and started flipping the first three cards.

He got two cards in before the front door flew open and smashed the wall of the inn with the door handle.

Toshiro glowered at the pair, no, trio behind the door. "Jamie, you're drunk, shouldn't you be going home? And Kain and Ifuma, too."

_Jamie_, as Ben had just found out the name of, staggered in past the door, an empty bottle in his clutches. "Nah, man! The night's just getting started! Gimme more!" And he walked up to the bar, almost missing as he planted his ass on a barstool, holding the empty bottle vaguely in Toshiro's direction. For reference, Toshiro was the bartender/inn keeper. Ben had learned his name throughout the night.

"And if I say no?" Toshiro responded.

To that, the other two men, Kain and Ifuma, walked forwards, standing close to the 'door' to behind the bar, cracking their knuckles. Their lips turned upwards as malice seeped into their eyes, a sparkle quite unlike many others.

"Oi-" Dari started to talk, before Ben stood up. He walked quietly over to the three men, not that far away from him. This was a smaller place, after all.

He did not need to be that quiet, though, they seemed... mighty distracted.

"Hey," Ben said, to get their attention. One arm crossed under the other, he looked might miffed. Ben was not the tallest guy in the world, but he was on the taller side, well over six foot.

That placed him taller than all three men here.

Normally, he really did not like flaunting his height like this. Here, though, it seemed like the perfect time.

Because it also had a total chance to not work. Which it did not.

The three turned to him, and seemed even madder.

"Look, how about you three just head on home, alright? Drink a bunch of water and eat something so you feel less like shit in the-"

One of them, Kain as Ben would later learn, threw a fist at Ben. "Who you calling shit?" he slurred out.

The punch was slow, and sloppy. It was not hard for Ben to just turn out of the way and not take it.

"I'm telling you, just go home and take a rest. Y'all have had enough."

The other one, apparently Ifuma, now looked rather miffed. "Who exactly are you to tell us what to do? Actually, who the fuck are you period?"

Ben sighed. These guys would be a pain. 

"Look, we don't have to do anything here at all, just head on home, or hell, just go burn off the drunkenness in a field or by a river or something. Then head home and slack off. It can actually be that easy."

It never was that easy. Kain had been the first to try to throw a punch. Kain was the first to throw a decent one.

And Ben was the first to catch the punch. In his hand, before letting the boy's hand go, as he was kind of amazed at what just happened. He looked at his hand, looked at Ben, back at his hand, and just stood there a moment.

It was only at the prompting of Jamie that Ifuma came back to his senses.

"Hey,  what are you doing? They don't wanna give us more, fine. Leave 'em be, we'll just grab it ourselves." And he walks over to open the door to the area behind the bar. Ben forces his way between Ifuma and Kain, perhaps a bit too powerfully, but so be it. With one hand, he held the door shut. For the first time since getting to town, his sleeve slipped down from his arm. While certainly not a body builder, he was far from a weakling. The muscles in his arm were visible now, though only slightly. The arms of a laborer, rather than of someone who trained for strength.

Kain seemed to notice them first, as he simply said "Ah, fuck it. Whatever. Y'all are no fun anyways," and headed to the door, though he just stood around outside it.

The other two, however took poorly to Ben's intervention. "Hey, fuck off, asshole," Jaime said, currently unable to open the door.

He turned to Ben and tried to kick him in the knee.

And promptly lost his balance as he kicked and fell to the ground.

Actually, the fall was pretty harsh. Ben would have to check on the early twenties kid to make sure he wasn't basically dying on the floor later.

This was made much easier as, seeing how he was all alone now, Ifuma huffed, and puffed, and left through the front door, kicking at stones with hands in his pockets.

That let Ben check on how Jaime was doing and...

Well Ben was no doctor, but he did not think it would be that bad. He hadn't blacked out, just been in pain for a bit.

At this point Dari came over and helped the boy too his feet, promising to take him home straight away.

Toshiro thanked Ben, and said the stay tonight was on the house.

Turns out, it did not matter than Ben was losing at Poker, he lucked out in the end anyways.
