title: It's Not An Addiction, I Swear! (Mission)
---

Ben stared ahead of himself at a vast ocean, stretching as far as the eye could see. The sun behind him as day turned to night, he decided to make camp, and figure out what to do in the morning.

***

It was morning. The fire was undeniably smothered. And the fire pit he had made was on a rocky outcropping anyways, there were few to no plants to potentially catch ablaze if he left.

So when Ben finished packing, that is exactly what he did. Like last night, he stood with the sun at his back, and walked.

***

He found the small town of Nikko. It was a small place, certainly not a ninja village. He had passed various fields on his way here, and assumed this was the town most of those farmers came by. Perhaps not to sell their goods, but as a form of communal recreation.

Perhaps most notable to Ben was that he saw what he believed to be an inn.

***

There were a lot of stares. The inn seemed to very much be the village bar. So here was a slightly larger, older guy walking in. Ben had zero idea if there were any ninja in this town, but he was thankful he had trained how to temper his chakra and be less noticeable.


<span class="zeeCustomColor">"Can I get a room for the night?"</span> he asked, standing at what he assumed was the bar, an older gentleman cleaning glasses.

<span class="zeeTownColor">"Ya know, so few people come here, doubt they bother to keep the rooms clean."</span> The voice came from behind Ben.

<span class="zeeToshiro">"Oh shut it ya coot, we still clean 'em. At least one at least,"</span> replied the inn keep. Looking to Ben, though, he whispered <span class="zeeToshiro">"Hey, mind waiting a bit while we get the room set up? But sure."</span>

The man behind Ben seemed to have heard, as he started cackling and going <span class="zeeTownColor">"I told ya! I told ya!"</span>

<span class="zeeTami">"Come here, newcomer,"</span> said a middle aged woman. Burly, but certainly not fat, she had a sort of jovial yet intimidating aura about her. <span class="zeeTami">"You ever played poker?"</span>

Ben walked over to the table after giving an affirmative nod to the inn keep. He cleaned his glasses before sitting down, meanwhile saying <span class="zeeCustomColor">"Yeah, I've played some poker. Won't call myself amazing but I won the occasional poker night back home."</span> The chair squeaked against the floor as he had a somewhat unfortunate time moving it into position.

And then Ben's face got a bit sad. <span class="zeeCustomColor">"But I'll just watch," he said, looking at the pot on the table. "Ain't got the cash to join y'all. Planned to ask around town, maybe get some odd jobs tomorrow."</span>

<span class="zeeTami">"Ah that's fine, sunny!"</span> said the middle aged woman. Ben was fairly sure she was the same age as him, or roundabouts, but he shrugged it off. Metaphorically, of course. <span class="zeeTami">"You play, and how's this. You win, we cover your stay at the inn, and split the pot between us. One of us wins and you get to have some fun in the middle of bum fuck nowhere! Name's Tami, by the way,"</span> she said. As been looked around the others at the table began to introduce themselves.

<span class="zeeDari">"Dari"</span>

<span class="zeeTownColor">"Jansen"</span>

<span class="zeeTownColor">"Sato"</span>

With all four introduced, Ben decided to introduce himself. <span class="zeeCustomColor">"Benjamin. Benjamin Lott, at your service. And I've love to play some under those rules."

So each of them gave Ben a handful of money to bet with, and off they went. Ben had a feeling he would like this town.

Ben was also able to get tonight's stay covered.
