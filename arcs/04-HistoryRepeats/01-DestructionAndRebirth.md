Three weeks.

Three weeks had passed since Ben had scared the encampment by the river away.

Three weeks of peace.

Three weeks of happiness.

Three weeks of joviality, three weeks of enjoyment, three weeks of wondering if this was, finally, the place for him to settle down.

Three weeks leading to his decision to stay, make this his new home.

It took three hours for everything to go wrong.

***

Jaime had been the first to make it to the inn, where Ben and Toshiro were playing cards. He opened the door, shouted "Run!" and then ran himself. Ben, attention caught by the goings on, turned fast enough to see Mio running past, baby in hand. Ben jumped out of his chair and ran to the door. Jaime was going door to door, telling people to run, and then running himself.

Ben turned around and saw why. In the distance, the fields had caught fire. Ben was surprised, there had not been a significant drought, or even really any drought, recently. But Ben could clearly see the fire, and while it was too far for him to see if it was approaching, it was worth not sticking around too long to find out.

Ben ran to the nearest field. It was so close to the town that the fire likely would be able to spread between the two.

There was a scream. Ben stopped where he stood, staring at the source of the scream. It was horrifying, and in seconds became closer to a gurgle rather than a scream. 

And there, stood in front of Ben, was someone he did not recognize.

Ok the ground next to the unknown person was Tami.

Her hands were around her neck and Ben could see, between her fingers, red liquid was pouring out.

Blood.

Her throat had been slit. Ben was stunned as he watched his friend bleed out on the ground mere feet from where he stood.

The world went red.

With every step, Ben's eyes grew whiter, his arms seemingly creating mist as he moved. With every step, he was faster, and stronger.

And outmatched.

Blinded by rage, Ben had charged the man. That was not like Ben, he did not fight that way, and for very good reason.

The man easily caught Ben's fist, and twisted his arm.

Ben heard a pop, but in the adrenaline rush, was unsure if that was a popped out shoulder, or perhaps even a broken arm. Pain was the last thing that could be on his mind right now, so it was. Perhaps not for the best, as the man, still holding Ben, swung for the face. Ben tried to block, to dodge, but...

Ben fell, staring at Tami, who lay inches from him.

Not... laying. He thought he saw a glint of life in her eyes but... she was unmoving, arms fallen away from her neck. Ben tried to watch her stomach, her chest, for movement, but his vision was fading, and he could not make out any.

Why? Why was this happening?

And all went black.

***

Tied. His hands were tied.

Bound. His legs were bound.

All this Ben figured out as he groggily awoke, sitting on a chair.

"Ah, welcome awake, we have been waiting for you!"

Black faded to hazy, and slowly to clear, as Ben opened his eyes. The first thing he noticed was that the man from the village, who had killed Tami, was right there. Ben was fairly certain he was the one that had talked.

Behind him was...

"Why?" Ben found his voice hoarse, barely functional.

"Why? Because you saw fit to annoy us."

"When?"

"Oh it's OK, you likely did not even realize! See, you aided and abetted a sworn enemy of mine, and then scared off my underlings. Now, you get credit for not _killing_ them. But that just means you won't die first!"

With that, the man raised one hand and pulled a small cord of metal. Lights came on, revealing the room. Concrete and metal, pillars every dozen feet or so, beams running along a high roof. And behind the man was what ben was most likely supposed to see.

"No. NO!"

Bound and gagged, laid behind the man...

Dari. Jaime. Jansen. Mio. Sato. Toshiro. And more.

***

One a day. They kept Ben tied up, forced him to eat and drink, and every day, one person died. Ben became numb, it was all too much, and... and he had the easiest time of it. He was new. These people, they knew each other. Some were family. To say they'd spent years in each other's company would be a lie.

Ben had barely been in town. He had wanted to make it home, so desperately wanted a place to simply live.

And... his attempts at making his every day life easier had backfired. Now everyone would die. And it was all his fault.

***

Jaime was killed early on, his body left there. Toshiro had passed away before it was "his turn". Dari had tried to fight back to save Mio, and had been _broken_ in response.

He died the next day.

And then they killed someone else.

More than once, Ben had tried to break the ropes and chains tying him down. Everyone he knew anymore sat before him, and saw as he channeled the beast within him. Always in vain. He could not break out.

***

There had to be some sadistic joy they got from leaving Ben sitting their, watching his friend's bodies, watching them fall one by one.

***

_So sleepy_ Ben thought. He watched a man fall, knife still in hand.

***

Tweets and chirps. What... what a nice dream, after so much horror.

Except... except it was no dream. Ben's eyes creaked open to see a... forest. He lay on the grass. Ben needed to process for a moment but...

Ben shot up, eyes going white and wisps of gas flowing from his arms in the gentle breeze.

And there was... nothing.

No line of dead bodies, or people 'waiting' for their turn to be slaughtered. The adrenalin faded as Ben came to the realization that he was alone, and the pain in his arm made itself known. At some point his shoulder had been (rather ungraciously) forced back into its socket, but that still fucking hurt, and it continued to hurt even now.

Just... trees. And grass. And..

Ben focus into himself for a minute and he felt... someone. He turned to face the person, anger on his face until...

"Kaden?" Ben became acutely aware of how tensed he was. And Kaden walked forwards, arms up and hands separated. "What are you doing here?"

"Ask her," Kaden replied simply, pointing to the left. Ben hazarded a glance and...

"Wait, what?"

"Hey, um..." She sighed.

"Name's Reina. Look, I was running with info from those guys who had you locked up. You harbored me for a night when I was basically fucked, and that basement of yours? They skipped right past assuming the place was empty. And just..."

The realization was starting to hit Ben.

"That town, and its people. Look, I didn't know them. But I'm sorry for them. And for you. I was going to the town to warn them about the people coming and, well. I saw your place burned down, and... basically everything else. So I got in touch with Kaden and we just..."

"It was too late."

She sighed. "Yeah, by then it was too late."

Ben relaxed some at that. He was exhausted, even though he had just woken up.

"We used a lead to find y'all," Kaden said. "But when we got there, there was only a handful still alive. Got you and them out but..." Kaden looked pained.

"They don't want to see me."

"They don't."

Ben sighed, and dropped his form, falling to the ground. "I-". He swallowed. "I can't blame them."

The two remained silent and distant. Ben had his own agony to deal with.
