title: Starting Off Wrong, Part 1 (Mission)
---



Sumashi Azuma was dead. Standing behind a rock was instead _The Masked_ ...Bandit.

Look, he would workshop the name later, or maybe just _not come up with one_ and, if he was AT ALL successful, just wait until people started calling him something.

And even with... The Masked Bandit... hyping himself up this much, it still just... all felt wrong.

Sum- The Masked Bandit was not a thief. He, under no circumstances, would have done this normally.

But these were not normal circumstances.

Behind the rock stood a man with no formal ninja training, and not accepted as a ninja refugee, but with enough informal ninja training to be _noticeably improved_ over the average person.

He was not accepted by the layperson, either.

Nobody wanted him, so here he stood, waiting for a small caravan to pass so he could nab enough to fucking eat.

And, the more he thought on it, the more he realized... he would need more than a single night's food.

He was so screwed.

***

<span class="zeeCustomColor">_This is it_</span> he thought, hearing the sound of approaching horses. They were not major merchants. He, The Masked Bandit, had made sure of that. He was also positive that he would NOT be calling himself that. At all. 

He felt like absolute, utter **shit**. He really did not want to steal from these guys. But right now, he was legitimately out of options. He was going to be utterly screwed in every single way if he did nothing. He needed... he needed money. He needed to be able to hide himself, at least a little.

He needed to be able to get to know some people. Above all else, he really needed people to talk to, people he could get to know. He was not a super social person, but his recent stints of rejection and he just... really wanted to talk to someone on good terms. It had been so long.

Swallowing the lump in his throat, The Masked Bandit, <span class="zeeCustomColor">_Oh fuck it no more calling myself that, even thinking it, it is just TOO BAD_</span>. Anyways, he quickly went behind the rock and, with the cart just barely past him, walked after it. The horse was not going fast, so he only needed a slight jog to catch up. Reaching the wagon, he lifted himself up to the "floor" level. This was a nice wagon, had a somewhat traditional looking door on it. Not a lock, though. Well, not one that could be locked from the outside, at least. He could easily open the door and step inside, gingerly closing the door so it would not rattle and alert the merchant. He knew what he was looking for, the box the merchant kept money in.

The issue was, he had zero idea what it looked like.

This would be... annoying.

The room itself was fine enough. There was a sleeping cot rolled up in the corner. He saw boxes of crates, not stacked high, and also strapped down from the looks of it. But there, next to the crates, was a particularly fancy box. He reached for it, picking it up, only to realize it was locked. Silently cursing to himself, he debated running off with the entire box and breaking it later but...

He did not want to make the merchant's life any worse.

So he took a deep breath, placed the box down, and began looking more. And there, in the rolls of the cot, was an ornate key. Hesitantly, he tried the key in the box and... the tiniest *click* was heard. He would have sighed in relief if the sound did not scare him so. Instead he opened the box and took a handful of money. He did not exactly count, but it should at least be enough to get through the next few days, and possibly small enough that the merchant would not notice. Then he locked the box back up, placed it where he found it, and returned the key to the cot.

He left, apologizing to himself, and to the merchant especially, once again carefully closing the door before being on his way.
