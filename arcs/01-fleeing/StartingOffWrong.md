Sumashi Azuma was dead. Standing behind a rock was instead _The Masked_ ...Bandit.

Look, he would workshop the name later, or maybe just _not come up with one_ and, if he was AT ALL successful, just wait until people started calling him something.

And even with... The Masked Bandit... hyping himself up this much, it still just... all felt wrong.

Sum- The Masked Bandit was not a thief. He, under no circumstances, would have done this normally.

But these were not normal circumstances.

Behind the rock stood a man with no formal ninja training, and not accepted as a ninja refugee, but with enough informal ninja training to be _noticeably improved_ over the average person.

He was not accepted by the layperson, either.

Nobody wanted him, so here he stood, waiting for a small caravan to pass so he could nab enough to fucking eat.

And, the more he thought on it, the more he realized... he would need more than a single night's food.

He was so screwed.
