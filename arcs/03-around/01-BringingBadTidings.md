Ben had a house now.

A small place, more out of the way then he might have liked, but... that did have its upsides.

The basement was... different. Though exactly how did not matter just yet.

What did matter, however, was the person collapsed on his front porch.

Ben carried her inside.

Ben was not an idiot. There were some things he had learned to hide, and some things he had learned to pay attention to.

This lady was not, in any way, shape, or form, normal. Outwardly, she looked like anyone who might be from this village.

But, of the few things Ben truly _knew_ how to do, ninja-wise, one of them was knowing that this lady was a ninja.

One of the few things that Ben did not need special knowledge to know is that, in one way or another, she had been brutalized and abused.

So he laid her on the couch, covered her up in a blanket, and got the closest thing he had to clothes that might fit her.

They wouldn't. 

But they were a little small for him, so maybe they would be ok?

He dragged a table over to the head of the couch and placed a water glass on it. 

At some point, he would relocate her to the basement. That would be the best case scenario. There were people much better at noticing these things than Ben was, and-

Ben shook his head for a moment. This was sounding like the thoughts of a maniac planning to take someone to their sex dungeon.

Nope, that was NOT it, AT ALL.
