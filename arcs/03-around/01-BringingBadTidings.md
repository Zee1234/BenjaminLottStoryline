title: (Don't) Shoot the Messenger (Mission)

Ben had a house now.

A small place, more out of the way then he might have liked, but... that did have its upsides.

The basement was... different. Though exactly how did not matter just yet.

What did matter, however, was the person collapsed on his front porch.

Ben carried her inside.

Ben was not an idiot. There were some things he had learned to hide, and some things he had learned to pay attention to.

This lady was not, in any way, shape, or form, normal. Outwardly, she looked like anyone who might be from this village.

But, of the few things Ben truly _knew_ how to do, ninja-wise, one of them was knowing that this lady was a ninja.

One of the few things that Ben did not need special knowledge to know is that, in one way or another, she had been brutalized and abused.

So he laid her on the couch, covered her up in a blanket, and got the closest thing he had to clothes that might fit her.

They wouldn't. 

But they were a little small for him, so maybe they would be ok?

He dragged a table over to the head of the couch and placed a water glass on it. 

At some point, he would relocate her to the basement. That would be the best case scenario. There were people much better at noticing these things than Ben was, and-

Ben shook his head for a moment. This was sounding like the thoughts of a maniac planning to take someone to their sex dungeon.

Nope, that was NOT it, AT ALL.

Ben rubbed his forehead with pointer and thumb.

His basement was better at hiding stuff-

_Dammit that sounded wrong, too!_

He had learned the Seal of Suppression. It had been a lot of work, and trips to libraries that were in neighboring towns, just to learn that it existed in the first place.

But Ben knew that, if he wanted to stay hidden, as a totally normal person, well the only way to do that was keep himself hidden.

So, at least in his basement, he could always be hidden.

And above? That is what chakra suppression was for, one of the first things his niece had taught him after he started showing promise, but not enough promise to really get anywhere. She said it was for if he was ever in danger and...

Well he was always in danger here, was he not?

***

Ben was reading a book on the upper floor when he heard a banging from below him. Not a violent banging.

Well, not like things being thrown around.

More like banging on a door.

Which would make sense, he did lock the basement door.

Ben walked into the stairway.

"Are you awake?" he asked, even though he knew the answer.

"...Yes" she replied, after a few seconds.

"Sorry about locking the door, it's a habit at this point," he said as he turned the switch, unlocking it.

She seemed... apprehensive.

While she stood in the basement, Ben could not read her Chakra. He had gotten used to sensing the chakra around him. It was a comfort. He began walking back up the stairs, planning to go back to his book.

"Wait," she said, and Ben waited. "You didn't tell anyone you saw me, right?"

"Not a soul. I don't want to risk the people of this town." Ben did not look at her. But his determination wavered. He knew this, hell he knew _she_, was dangerous. But that question scared him more. This was not the life he wanted.

"Why are you out here?" she asked. She was walking up the stairs now.

"I'm just a normal guy trying to live out my middle age in peace after the tumult of my younger years."

"Get better at hiding yourself, then," she said.

Ben froze. He had not been ascending the stairs, certainly. But his whole body stopped moving. "What?" is all he managed. It was not a what of anger, hatred, or malice. It was said almost with a puppy dog intonation.

"The only thing more obviously a ninja that someone in a hairband," she began, "is a person without any chakra signature."

Ben stood there for a minute, went "Ah", and ascended the stairs. The woman left, with her package, and, as Ben would later realize, his leftover clothes.

He hoped that was not a serious mistake.
