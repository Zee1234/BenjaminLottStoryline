title: A New Way Home

Sumashi Azuma was dead.

He kept telling himself that. But...

He was not young. Nobody would make that mistake anymore. He was getting up there in age. To say otherwise was dumb, and frankly just wrong.

He sighed. The money he had stolen from the merchant burned a hole in his pocket. There was no way he could manage to live like this. A ninja by technicality, but not by training. A man forced to thievery. He had wondered, standing behind that rock, if maybe the act of stealing would be _exhilarating_. If maybe it was something that he would somehow _enjoy_. That thought had shaken him to his core as he stood at that rock.

And here he stood, despising himself for what he had done. What he had become. Was that better than if he had enjoyed it?

***

<span class="zeeCustomColor">_It smells of rain_</span>. The thought popped into his mind, blocking out the other troubles had been thinking about.

Looking around, he had to find a place to hide from the rain. Spying a stone outcropping, he decided to go there. He had spent some of his money already, getting the bare minimum. A few flasks for water, a backpack to store things in, and a smaller bag of rice among them.

Sighing, he walked to the outcropping, placed his things down, and began gathering twigs for a fire.

***

It was a bad rain. Really bad.

He had seen worse, but it was a good idea to have hunkered down. "In sheets". That is how he could best describe the rain coming down.

A small tin was heating up some of the rainwater over the small fire he had constructed. 

He thanked the heavens that it was not terribly windy. This much rain, with wind, and his rocky outcropping would have been doing jack shit.

Even now, the drops were close to him. It took multiple minutes to find a spot that was not slowly dripping onto his body.

The ground was a haze of water thrown into the air, and visibility was little to none. He was once again thankful for this little outcropping. It's floor was slightly above the surrounding area. Perhaps there was a reason for that. Perhaps rains had eroded the ground itself, but the section of rock under the overhand had been protected by its 'hood'.

Whether right or wrong, it was a nice thought. A _neutral_ thought. Something he so desperately needed right now.

He imagined that the light of the fire served as a good beacon, being probably the only source of light visible for quite a ways around.

***

The rice was boiling, and the water was cooking, when he noticed an approaching... something. The shadow in the rain and haze looked vaguely humanoid, and he really had nothing to fear.

What, would he be robbed blind of what little he had? It would just be karma.

So he decided to call out into the rain <span class="zeeCustomColor">"Hey! You out there! Come in out of the rain! I've got some cover here!"</span>

He really had to shout to make sure he was heard over the sound of the rain, but the shadowy figure stopped, and then as he finished speaking, walked towards the fire faster.

As the figure got out of the rain, his details became more obvious. A long, green coat was clasped shut around him, holding the rain at least somewhat at bay. Above his head he carried a leaf, likely a makeshift umbrella. Likely a very large leaf that appeared up to the task.

And even with that protection, he, and especially his backpack, looked absolutely soaked.

<span class="zeeNPCColor">"Thanks for yelling out mate, I wasn't sure what I was seeing here, what with all the rain! Name's Kaden, what's yours?"</span>

And there was the single most feared question that had been asked. Not knowing how to answer, he took a deep breath before just... speaking.

<span class="zeeCustomColor">"Benjamin."</span> It was a simple name, at least in some of the places he had travelled it was. He had met many Benjamins while walking through Moon Country.

<span class="zeeNPCColor">"Well, Benjamin,"</span> he said, a smile growing on his face as he took off the large coat and what could only be described as a beanie hat. <span class="zeeNPCColor">"It's nice to meet you! Nice to see that I was not the only one caught out in the rain. Where you headed?"</span>

Kaden seemed to be eyeing... _Benjamin_. That name would take getting used to. But might as well keep it, now.

<span class="zeeCustomColor">"Going east, I guess. I've already travelled... well I've already traveled over most everything. Haven't gone too far south or too far north but... I guess I'm just going to go East until I decided to stop."</span> Benjamin checked the rice, giving it a stir with a spoon/fork/knife hybrid thingy that he had picked up with some emergency supplies.

<span class="zeeNPCColor">"Well I got some good news and some bad news for you, Benjamin,"</span> Kaden said, drying his black, curly hair with a towel that Benjamin was not entirely sure of the origins of. Probably just a deep pocket in Kaden's backpack, which Ben. Yes, _Ben_ was a good way to say it. The backpack, which Ben now noticed was sitting on a rock, opened and airing out. The insides actually seemed rather dry, so apparently it was a fairly well waterproofed backpack. <span class="zeeNPCColor">"You're about as _East_ as you can go. Maybe you can rent a ship to go even further _East_, but, and I don't mean to be rude here, but you don't look like the type that could afford a ship."</span>

Ben smiled. <span class="zeeCustomColor">"No, probably not,"</span> he thought. He had already had to sneak aboard a ship from Flowers to Island, and then from Island to Honey. Just more things to add to his growing list of crimes that he somehow got away with.

That thought took a bit of the smile on his face. <span class="zeeCustomColor">"But have I really gotten that far East?"</span> he asked, surprised about what he, a mostly normal (well, originally normal) middle aged guy had managed. That was a long way to travel and... well he thought on it some, and it felt like it all flew by too fast. Days had turned into weeks, yes, but it did not feel particularly long.

Ben wondered what that meant. Did he just lose track of time? Or was it something more.

<span class="zeeNPCColor">"Yep,"</span> said Kaden, rather matter-of-factly. <span class="zeeNPCColor">"Anyways, thanks for giving me a bit of a chance to dry off, but I do gotta get going! Places to be, people to meet."</span>

With that, a closed up his backpack, and a coat he put back on when Ben didn't notice, he was gone. Ben barely had a chance to react before Kaden hopped off the rock. But he did notice one thing.

Kaden's clothes were already dry.

That was... certainly strange.

But that would be a matter to think about another time, another day.

<span class="zeeCustomColor">"Bye, Kaden!"</span> Ben would shout into the rainfalls, unsure if he was heard by the mysterious man.
