Sumashi Azuma was dead. Long Live The Lost Kingdom.

Or some shit like that.

It was... disappointing. Sumashi had never been a ninja, never dealt with that world. He had loved learning simple things from his niece, who had decided to be one. Perhaps not the smartest move, but who could deny a face like that? His niece had been teaching him small things over the years. Apparently he had an _aptitude_ that not many had. He was _good_.

And that was _bad_.

Well, as his niece grew better, he stopped practicing. Sumashi was not a ninja, and while learning the ninja arts were not for him, it was not awful.

It was... sad. His niece had been out of the village of Iwagakure when the city first fell. Not to dust, not destroyed, but demoted, so to speak. His niece left a member of a respected nation, and came back to a disgrace of a village, subjugated by a once small village.

It was... distressing. She had taken to the drink. Sumashi tried to talk to her, get her to be OK with what had transpired. But she had not been there to help her home.

Sumashi kept telling her how he preferred her alive. How this was, fucked up as it was, the better outcome.

It was... painful. Sumashi's brother pounded on the door one day, early in the morning. Sumashi, while awake, was certainly not ready to start the day. But he did not really have a choice.

His niece was gone.

***

He wondered, for years, if there was something he could have done. Sumashi felt weak. His home had been weak, once, and that was too much for his niece. She had left. He felt responsible. If he had this potential, why did not not embrace it earlier in his life? His teacher was his god fucking damn twelve year old NIECE! And he was... not horrible! He had given up on it all at one point, but, in the face of it all, why had he not just... fought to get stronger?

Sumashi lost his brother to a work accident not too long after his niece left. Sometimes, he wondered if he was distracted, thinking about her.

But that was neither here nor now.

Right now, he was watching the husk of the place he had called home crumble. Iwagakure had been attacked, and Sumashi had been entirely unable to help. Entirely unable stop it. Only able to run away, and pray for survival.

Sumashi hated this.

Hated the war, death, and destruction that followed the Ninja everywhere.

Hated that he knew enough to be considered _a threat_.

But he did not wish to further the death and destruction. He only wished to be left alone, to live in peace. He wanted nothing more than to be _safe_ and _free_, and he wished that for everyone.

Sumashi did not want revenge. Revenge begot naught but Revenge.

Sumashi wanted peace. And if he had to fight for it? So be it.
