Now this?

This was a mission Junko could _get behind_. 

She gad gotten this mission the day before, but with the snake oil sales taking up most of her day, and this mission requiring some prep work, Junko had decided to wait until the next day.

Now, she was _required_ to deliver snacks and water to the slums.

What would be _better_ for her standing among the people of the slums would be if she brought whole meals, even simple ones like a chowder, and extra ingredients that families could use for meals in a longer term that were easy to store.

On said day before, she had gone to a handful of stores, asking for things like rice or noodles, often large bags.

Not to take herself, no. This was far too short a notice to build up the sort of trust needed for that.

Rather, she asked if someone from the store was willing to bring things down tomorrow as a donation to the people of the slums.

Junko did not expect many shops to go for it, but that is exactly why she cast the net quite a big larger than was possibly needed.

Fast forward to the next day, and Junko wheeled in a large pot she borrowed from someone who may or may not have known it was her that borrowed it yet. She built up a fire under the pot, and filled it with the chowder ingredients, which she had already prepared.

She was pleased when a few more shops had sent things than she had expected, and one place offered to add their rice to the chowder, which would admittedly probably improve it.

So Junko began distributing. Some brought their own bowls, others Junko provided and washed when they were returned. Or just let people walk away with them. She was trying to build up a _good_ profile here, after all. Gotta have people thinking "That Junko girl sure was nice."

A fair amount of the supplies had come from the mission place, but the soup itself was 'self' provided.

Mostly by getting 'donations' from family and neighbors. Though Junko thought she played it smart. She asked if someone was going to the shops that day, and if they were, she asked for _specific items_ rather than asking for money. She figured that would make people more willing to give her things.

This had worked so well that her total expenditure for this whole thing was basically zero, time excluded. But this was setting up Junko as a Friendly Face within the village, which was one part of why she was doing all these seemingly menial labor tasks for people. She sought to ingratiate herself to most people, be happy, joyous, always ready to crack a joke, or laugh at ones. Gotta be careful with the laughing, though. Laugh to hard at a bad joke and it feels more like a pity laugh than anything.

That one had taken her a very long time to figure out.

But anyways, Junko would spend her day distributing chowder and smaller bags of rice and noodles that families could likely extend to last awhile, even here in the slums. Some stores even brought small things of spices that some families were really happy to see and use.

After that, Junko spent awhile handing out gallons of water. Apparently, the water here would sometimes shut down and people needed the gallons of water to tide themselves over in the meantime.

Junko would be saving that little factoid in the back of her mind.
