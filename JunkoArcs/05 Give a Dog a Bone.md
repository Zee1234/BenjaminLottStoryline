Shadow art was interesting. As an art form, Junko could appreciate it.

But that specific artist was a complete and total _asshole_. Totally absorbed into her own ego. Anything besides perfection was _wrong_, and mistakes were _never_ her fault.

Junko wanted to SCREAM, but there were people around. So she swallowed, forced down her feelings, and _moved on_. 

It was back to get a new mission. Perhaps this time with someone who was _less conceited_ and full of themselves?

That was the dream, at least.

With a shake of her head, to work past these feelings, Junko returned once again to get another job. It was far easier to just _move on_.

[hr]

It seemed that the normal lady that Junko got missions from was on lunch. While unfortunate, Junko simply asked for another mission from someone else. 

This person did not know Junko's... _preferences_ for missions, though. And, despite complaint, this was the job she was given, as it was higher priority, and she was there.

On one hand, she now the dog freaks were important to the village.

On the other hand, fuck them.

She didn't even feel like _thinking_ eloquently about them.

So with a deep breath and a forced smile, she went off to work to get this done _as fast as she could possibly manage_.

[hr]

The butcher seemed nice enough, but Junko was literally walking into multiple nearly complete cows. Sure, they were _packaged_ but...

They were wet. And Junko had a felt pretty confident in the guess that the "wetness" of the wrappings were not water from the faucet.

At the very least, she felt comfortable displaying some of her discomfort. She was used to forcing smiles, and at least now she could make it look _obviously_ forced, rather than have to work around that image and be genuine.

She had been told by the butcher that these were all destined for the Inuzuka clan, and that made it exactly zero percent better, and _possibly_ worse.

Dogs were actually awful. Territorial, disgusting creatures, that carried pests and disease. 

Junko was _sure_ that the Inuzuka probably took better care of their dogs than most, but at the end of the day, they were still mangy mutts and this was far more than she thought they deserved.

_However_, she deserved a nice pay day, so she would power through!

Thank all that was, is, and would be that everything was already all packaged. All she had to do was move it to the cart so that it could easily be taken across the village despite how much _fucking meat_ there was in the pile.

Junko honestly wondered if any of this was destined for people to eat, or if it was all for the dogs. She had not seen the packaging of the pieces, and while the wrapped things were labeled, the labeling was archaic and Junko could make neither head nor tails of it.

_Oh well_, she thought. Today was a day to put things where she was told to put them and do nothing else.
