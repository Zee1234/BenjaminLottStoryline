It was three o'clock now, and Junko stood in front of a very large building! The kind lady at the mission place had given Junko the insider info about this job! Apparently, this was a noble's house, and every year, without fail, the family cat would go missing. It just so happened to always be on the day that she was scheduled for her yearly vet appointment!

The lady at the mission place knew that the cat's checkup was this year, and that the person was a regular, so after having told Junko about the mission, well, she decided to stay in the waiting room until the mission was available! And that is how Junko ended up here, in front of a _very_ large home. Well, a mansion. And she was here to find a cat! Certainly something she could do!

After using the ornate, quite possibly solid gold and not just plated, knocker on the large oak doors, Junko was greeted by a somewhat elderly man opening the door. He wore a white button up with black buttons, and a bow tie adorned his heck. He also had on a suit jacket, though the posture of him and the jacket implied that these were clothes designed for working in, not for pure visual appeal.

He was very severely balding, but clearly took care to shave the top of his head and keep the ring of hair that stretched from behind his ears around the back of his head very neat and tidy. This hair was, of course, quite grey with age. Oddly, though, his mustache, which was also obviously well maintained, was entirely black hair. The two sections of mustache seemed to form a nearly perfect V shape, but the V was upside down. 

"Hello! My name is Junko Wara! I'm here to help with the cat situation!" Junko's excitement was positively _infections_, but the old man held his "bored with life but somehow still respectful" gaze, looking down to her. "Of course, Ms. Wara. The Master would greatly appreciate if you could locate Mr. Scruffles before his vet appointment."

"Certainly, my good sir!" she would say, before he steps to the side to let her in. From here, the man offered her tea and biscuits, which Junko politely refused, before asking him a handful of questions.

Who had last seen Mr. Scruffles?

Where had he last been seen?

How long ago was this?

Is Mr. Scruffles an outdoor cat?

Does he enjoy being outdoors ever?

All told, the cat was nearly certainly in the building. So Junko would get to work! While she could run rather fast, she did not want to risk breaking anything in this place. It may very well cost far more than her mission would reward! Better to not go broke!

Junko eventually found the cat hiding in the closet of one of the spare bathrooms. Junko considered if there was something to do about this, locking the door behind her as she approached the cat, who was not yet aware of her presence.

But money was worth more than temporary fun, especially as she was currently rather poor! So Junko grabbed a nearby towel and leaped at Mr. Scruffles to wrap him in the towel.

After delivering her mark to what she presumed was the butler, she collected her reward and went back to the mission depot.
