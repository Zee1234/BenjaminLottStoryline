The last person Junko did a mission for was a right twat. She had wanted to walk out many, many times, but knowing this one a one time thing, for cash, and there might be downsides if she backed down from a mission right after having accepted it, she had just finished off her time there, hating every moment of it, and faking a smile even as the photographer yelled at her.

Junko was wearing a pair of looser jeans and a somewhat large white shirt she had tucked into her pants. Do not misinterpret, earlier in the day, she had most certainly been wearing more "ninja-y" clothing. Specifically, earlier today, she had been wearing a green dress and matching pants. The dress itself was short enough to be considered immodest if it had not quite obviously gone with the pants she was also wearing. These were very "ninja-y" as far as she considered. They were somewhere between casual and uniform. Not so fancy as to be stiff for the purpose of looks, but not so casual as to look rushed together.

Now, however, her clothes were decidedly more casual.

Or perhaps a better right phrase was that they were decidedly more "manual labor" focused. 

After all, she had requested a job that "did not involve human interaction" after that fuck fest of a mission with the most unbelievably unlikeable person.

Even Junko pretended to care about other people.

At this point, in her decidedly more casual or labor favoring outfit, Junko was stabbing the ground repeatedly.

Well. She was repeatedly stabbing leaves that had fallen to the ground. Then, as the number of leaves on her poking stick got too many for it to be very effective, she would lift it up and slide them all into a large paper bag she had been tasked with carrying around.

This was... not _hard_ work, but tedious work, and it was a surprisingly hot Autumn day as Junko was talking around stabbing leaves so that they could eventually be composted and the common areas of the village would continue looking great.

She was glad she had a water bottle with her. It was hanging off a cross body pouch thing she had gotten basically just for the water bottle. If she ever went out on a mission or whatever, it would probably be too cumbersome to use.

But it was bigger than the flasks she could carry around on belt straps and, perhaps the most important thing of all, _did not require her to put on one of those ugly ass utility belts_. 

So every once in awhile, Junko would stop the stabbing of leaves (which was admittedly cathartic, in a sort of odd way), clear off the poking stick into the brown 'trash' bag, and then lift the bottle and its cross body holster. She would take a few sips (after opening it, of course), then twist the thing closed again, before getting back to work.

It was maybe two hours that passed of this working cycle before she was satisfied.
