So, every once in awhile, the Akimichi would host extravagant and large lunches and/or dinners for almost anyone to partake in.

What Junko was _not_ sure about was if the Akimichi ever held these events specifically in the _slums_. 

She knew there was an area they often used, as it was close to where they all lived, and easy to move things there.

And that area _was not_ close to the slums. Actually, it was fairly far, truth be told.

If you have been following Junko's recent exploits, you may be tracking what she is plotting right now.

Junko wants to get the Akimichi to have their grand feasts among the slums, though perhaps downplaying the "grand" part, and make sure the people of the slums are the _first_ to be allowed to partake, after the clan itself.

Well, and after Junko. But that was a default assumption.

[hr]

So, as it turns out, convincing the Akimichi to hold their community feast in the middle of the slums is actually super hard?

But Junko was determined. She worked with the various individuals she was ping ponged between to come up with an idea. Overall, the Akimichi organizers seemed to be in favor of it, but only with assurances. For starters, Junko _had_ to be on clean up assistance, since this was her idea, and it was far too easy for it to end up going horribly wrong, at least in the mess making department.

...There were several among the Akimichi who did not exactly think highly of those living in the slums.

_All the more reason to make sure those people knew that Junko was one who could be trusted._

At the end of the day, well, after several days of work, really, Junko had gotten them to agree to a handful of points, and the Akimichi organizers seemed to except the deal with the stipulations.

First and foremost, Junko was expected to help with the setup and cleanup. And if there was "an event" that caused a significant amount of mess, or even damage? Junko was on the hook for that.

Junko felt confident, though.

Secondly, while the Akimichi would produce more food by volume than they normally did for these, they would be making less extravagant food overall. This worked for Junko, because that meant more people could get food they needed, and it worked for the Akimichi organizers because it meant this would be a cheaper feast than normal, even with having to transport things to the site of the meal.

It could also be easily explained to the other Akimichi and any "Esteemed Guests" that this was a charity event, first and foremost, and as such the Akimichi organizers had focused on a middle ground between quality and quantity, and felt that the food being prepared was a good balance between being frugal and being giving.

Thirdly, and finally, Junko was expected to work the event, not just enjoy it.

Junko was entirely fine with that. She would have suggested it if the Akimichi organizers had not posited the idea first. Of course, since it was their idea, even though Junko had planned to do this anyways, she pretended to begrudgingly agree to the stipulation after hemming and hawing over it.

[hr]

It was the day of the feast and Junko was prepared. While the Akimichi were preparing the feast themselves, Junko was running around helping set up. She had spent the past week telling anyone and everyone who would listen about the feast the Akimichi were holding, swearing that she would make sure that any who wanted it would get fed.

So on the grand day of, Junko was pleased when a handful of the locals walked up to her and asked if they could help. While sweating a bit (mostly from the heat), Junko smiled and directed them to tables that they could help set up. These were not the normal tables used by the Akimichi, they were in many ways simpler, but they should be fine. And of key importance: there were a lot.

The Akimichi would be sitting at the head of the table and serving themselves from a buffet for them, alongside their _Esteemed Guests_.

Optimistically, Junko figured this was because they ate more to sustain their special techniques, and above all, this was meant to be their day, and they shared it with the community at large.

Pessimistically, Junko could only imagine this was based, at least in part, and possibly not even consciously, in some deep seeded discriminatory beliefs.

Which Junko totally understood, regardless of if one agrees or disagrees, it is hard to deny that those sorts of stereotypes existed.

Junko, however, very purposely positioned herself at the serving table meant for _everyone else_.

She was also glad to see that some Akimichi were making a point to come through the line she was serving from.

Or perhaps they did not care one way or another, or there was some infighting they did not feel like getting involved with, or....

Well really the list of possibilities would go on and on if Junko really tried to think them out.

At the end of the day, it did not matter. Junko had positioned herself as a benefactor, and the Akimichi organizers looked, perhaps not poorly about it, but certainly not great.

The day thankfully went off without a hitch. There was some unrest as Junko's supply of food began to wane before the line was fully served, but one of the more _friendly_ Akimichi members brought over some food from the other buffet line. While it seemed there had been hushed arguments, Junko had been eyeing it for awhile, and the Akimichi at the head of the table had not touched that table for awhile, aside from the occasional person grabbing a small amount, particularly desserts. Considering that the desserts were _not_ on the list of things brought over to Junko's table, she was fine with this arrangement.

[hr]

It would also be stupid to think that Junko did this out of the good of her heart. With every person served, Junko tried to read them, and make a guess. If they seemed to live in this area, which near certainly would mean they were not themselves ninja, she would slip a piece of paper under their plates. Except there was one more requirement for her to give them a paper: they had to look annoyed, or even angry, about the Akimichi sitting separately.

Junko was watching the group carefully. She had attended some events of theirs. They seemed committed to ideals but...

They were small, and their methods were... _less_ than persuasive.

There current tactics _might_ work if they grew in numbers, though, and Junko saw a future in that group. A future that was _very_ enticing to her.

Junko knew her own limits, she knew her body was broken. And, even if she could climb in the world of ninja, she would be hindered at every step of the way.

So she smiled as she handed papers to those who looked pained and, perhaps, disillusioned, at the current state of things.

For you see, while gaining the trust and hearts of those in the slums, Junko's true goal was much higher.

But that was something for far in the future, not for these brief moments of communication with the people of the village.

So Junko kept handing out food. If the Akimichi organizers were watching, if they _had_ been watching, and if they had known what the Higanbana were, what they stood for...

Well, Junko was happy this was a reality that lived only in her imagination.

But the people seemed to be enjoying the food, and a handful being perplexed by the graphics they had received.

And a handful that, shortly after seeing the flyer, hid them away.

Junko was glad she was not working alone, though. It was easy to hid the flyers on trays after they had been filled with food and utensils and everything else.

The last thing she wanted was someone to know it was her handing these out.

Being the only ninja in the group running this section absolutely had its upside. If anyone did notice and question it, she would likely be the last person suspected of doing something.

After all, many people, many ninja mainly, considered the Higanbana to be _anti-ninja_ when, really, they were more pro-civilian. It was a distinction that mattered, but could very honestly be ignore, and changes most everything about the situation.

And, at the end of the day, when Junko still had some left over? She walked around the area, leaving them in places that were somewhat out of the way, but also hard to miss. _Eventually_, they would be found.

The entire hope was just that they wouldn't be found until Junko was clear of them all.
