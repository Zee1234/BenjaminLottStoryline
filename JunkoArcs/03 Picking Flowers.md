It was now decidedly in the 'afternoon' part of the day that was bordering 'evening'. While not yet relinquishing its control of the sky, the sun was decidedly lower and commanded less attention to its presence. This was a joyous part of the day, as one rarely if ever will turn their head and be blasted by the searing light of the sun. It was far enough above the horizon to still be pleasant.

All this was barely noticed by Junko as she once again returned to the mission office. It seemed to be hot in here, as the mission lady was sweating! Well, Junko thought the temperature was fine, but maybe there was a difference if you actually worked in the building for a long time. 

It was barely after walking in that she was given a mission to go and pick flowers. Nodding, Junko walked out of the building and to where she was supposed to meet this person.

It was the friendly lady who ran one of the Yamanaka flower shops! Well, Junko was far from _surprised_ by this outcome. Most flower shops seemed to be run by the Yamanaka, after all. Sometimes it even seemed as if, when someone else opened up a flower shop, they handed it over to a Yamanaka within a few weeks! Such strange people in this village of leaves.

"Hello, my name is Junko Wara!" She stood, hands clasped behind her back, in front of the shop. The woman seemed to be handling a few things at the side of the shop, but the door had been propped open, so Junko figured she was probably easily heard.

"Ah, hello dearie, are you here to buy some flowers?" The woman stood up. She was very obviously on the elderly side. Junko think she had a better understanding of why the woman wanted assistance, now. Even if she had been truly spectacular in her prime, she was old enough that she was very probably limited in her capacity. Still running a store at her age was quite something.

"No, ma'am. I am here to help you get flowers ready for a larger order."

"Ah, yes! I did put in that mission. Oh thank you, dearie. It is quite a large order, and it can be difficult to grab everything I need to throughout the day."

"What can I help you with?" Junko said, rocking back and forth on her feet. Toes up, head forwards, back back, moving to heels up, head back, and front forwards. Not very much, just a bit. It was a good way to appear as if raring to get to work.

"I have actually started! But you can help me out by grabbing more flowers as I start arranging them. They asked for so many types of flowers, and so many others they just vaguely described!"

"Alright, just tell me what to get!" Junko walked over towards the wall of flowers and began grabbing what she was asked for. Many times, the older woman had to direct her a little more specifically with things like 'third collection from the right, second row from the top', but over the next hour or so, Junko had helped build a most beautiful bouquet.

After the pair had finished her work, Junko bid the elderly woman farewell and started working her way home. Her mother would likely be finishing dinner around now, and her favorite receptionist at the mission depot would be off work anyways. No need to head back there today.
