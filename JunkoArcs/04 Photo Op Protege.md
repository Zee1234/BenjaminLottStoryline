It was a beautiful day!

Junko had a stretch and got out of bed, though a bit less enthusiastically than she had the day before. 

Also unlike yesterday, she did not forget her morning face!

And in an unfortunate difference from yesterday, her mom was in the one bathroom as she woke up. Oh well, she could wait a bit. It was not quite as dire as having forgotten her morning basics yesterday! Still annoying.

Junko went down the stairs to ask her dad what he was making.

Waffles sounded great.

Then, as she head the bathroom door opening back up, she rushed back up the stairs, going two at a time, and almost running over her mother at the top!

A "Be careful!" and rushed apology later, and Junko would begin her day.


[hr]

Junko's first mission today was to take place in a...

_Giant Box_.

There was a massive black tarp, probably about two stories tall, held up but a bunch of poles and crossbars and things. 

Shrugging, Junko entered the tent.

Only to be met by a _very_ irate voice.

"AH, CLOSE THAT DAMN THING!" she yelled out. "You are ruining my art!!!"

Junko fumbled a bit while closing the tarp and letting darkness take over the entire room. The angry woman seemed increasingly upset with every fumble. Junko _considered_ playing into it more, but thought better of it.

"Sorry bout that, my bad."

"Yes, your bad! Why are you here anyways, ruining the vibe?"

Junko hated her.

"I am Junko W-"

"Didn't ask."

Junko blinked. At least she pretended to not be a complete asshole.

"You had a job posted requesting assistance while taking pictures." Junko brought her arms up to her chest, crossing them under the other, and leaned ever so slightly to the side while turning her head in obvious dissatisfaction.

She was supposed to be _nice_, not a pushover.

"Ah, welcome, welcome!" This was the first time the woman had bothered looking at Junko. She even stood up, arms spread, as if wanting a hug. Though Junko was fairly certain she was just trying to express excitement that she was not really feeling, but that she felt she needed to give to appease for her prior mistake.

Junko, while not impressed, looked down and took a deep breath, and got to it.

"Aight, so, what can I do for you? The mission request was... exceedingly vague."

"Ah, yeah, sorry about that. Ok, see these things?" The woman pointed towards a bunch of letters on the floor. Rather tall blocky letters, but letters nonetheless.

"Are the photos going to be of a poem or something?"

The woman seemed particularly annoyed. "Gods, no. Can't you see I'm trying to make shadow art??"

Is there a way for a person to audibly make an ellipsis without saying the word? Because that is just what Junko did.

"Ugh, just, look, go grab that light, stick it on the floor, and point it how I tell you to point it, OK?"

And so Junko did.

For _three hours_.
