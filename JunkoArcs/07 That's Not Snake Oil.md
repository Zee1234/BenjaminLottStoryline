Junko lived well at home. At times, her relationship with her immediate family was rocky, but she always found a way to work through it.

Her extended family was a bit different. While nearby, Junko simply did not see them that often. 

An exception to this was her grandmother. Junko had figured out about a year ago that her grandmother, her mother's mother, was declining in her old age. Not yet physically, but it was noticeable.

So, Junko was understandably annoyed when some snake oil conniving con man tricked her grandma into paying top fucking dollar for _god damn vegetable oil_. It left her grandma in enough of a financial bind to be disadvantageous!!! And all for some promise of "eternal life" or some bullshit like that.

Junko _would_ find this person.

...after a quick trip to the mission depot, as she was fairly certain that there was a mission that sounded very similar to this whole situation. She might as well get paid for dishing it out.

[hr]

Junko decided to ask the Yamanaka flower shop owner about it. She was helpful enough. The man had come by her shop the other day, trying to peddle his bullshit to the customers. He had been chased off pretty quickly, but the shop owner suspected he was really there to find out where people who may be older and slower lived. 

With some assistance from the shop owner, Junko now had an idea of where to start her searching.

[hr]

Junko only had to spend around two hours sitting on top of the roof of a somewhat taller building before the man revealed himself.

And for 'revealed himself', it should be known that the phrase is referring to him trying to con another person of their money. Said person slammed the door shut, but he barely even faltered, the smile never leaving his face as he walked to the next door and knocked.

...Maybe Junko's grandmother was a bit further gone than she thought if this simple a tactic had worked on her.

Junko made her way down from the roof to the ground, not too far from the man. She was not really trying to be quiet, but she did not go out of her way to be loud, either, and the street just a bit further away was a little on the busy side. Carts coming through every now and then, a bit extra noise would be practically unnoticeable.

"-want to be around for your grandkids? I'm selling this potion of Eternal Life, though, between you and me, 'Eternal Life' is actually just the brand name. But it is proven to help keep one healthier for longer! So who wouldn't want to hang around with their family for more years?"

_Ok_, Junko thought. _If that's his gimmick, I can see how that might trick some people._

And with that thought, she walked up to the man, grabbed his wrist, and THREW him over the banister into a bush.

And she, with him struggling the entire way, would lead him to the nearest police station.
