It was a beautiful day!

The sun shone in onto Junko, its beams weaving their way through the curtains she had hung up over her window.

Sitting up slowly, Junko reached upward and outward, her other hand making a fist and being near to her face. And then with a deep breath, she tensed her muscles, leaned her head towards her hand that was in a fist, and PUSHED! out against the air, letting out a big old breath as she settled down.

_Today would be a good day!_ she thought as she jumped out of bed (literally!) and ran to the bathroom, thankful to find that neither of her parents were currently using it. After the most needful things had been handled, she looked into the mirror.

Oops! She had not put on her morning face yet!

How did that go again? Vaguely like...

Junko moved her hands around her face, moving certain muscles certain ways. Sure, she could absolutely do this without needing her hands, but they gave a sort of reassurance; even if she forgot the normal way, her hand and arm muscle memory could help her remember.

After trying out a few smiles in front of the mirror and deciding upon one, Junko went downstairs. She smelled bacon!

[hr]

The mission lady was so nice! She helped Junko pick out a mission, and get right to it! Junko had had a bit of a late start with all of this, after all, considering the accident that had left her broken.

But the past was in the past, the future was yet to come! Junko knew she could figure it out, she just had to try!!!

So today, Junko was going to help out a kind elderly man with his shopping! Apparently his wife had passed recently (So sad!!) and he needed help carrying things around the stores!

"Hello!" she said, approaching the man, a very wide smile upon her face.

"Oh! You startled me!" he replied. "Are you the one helping me out today?" His voice was shaky, showing his age. It also lacked... _something_. A quality that Junko noticed in the way some people talked. She noticed it when the girls she knew years ago had talked about their crushes, or when her cousin was with their significant other. Junko could never quite put a name to it, but she noticed when people talked without it. Certainly it was not an 'all the time', think, but just as it was for her parents, she expected that the old man had not used that tone, had that skip in his beat, for a very long time.

"That I am!" Junko replied. While still smiling, she let it become a more modest smile. 

"Shall we get started, then?" he asked, seemingly infected by her enthusiasm and youth.

"Certainly!" she replied.

The two would spend the rest of the day shopping. At least twice the man asked if Junko was able to carry all the bags, and both times Junko showed that she most certainly could! She was very capable of doing that!

With that, the hours passed and Junko found herself walking the old man home about about two o'clock.
